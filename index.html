               1. People like to laugh. And trust me, you’ll be doing plenty of that! <br> Whether it’s trying to keep your balance in our 25-degree angled tilt room,<br>  or making faces in the distorted mirrors, you won’t be able to contain yourself! <br>
               2.It’s wacky and has optical illusions that will make your head spin <br> People love things that play with the mind’s eye- when what we see disagrees with reality. <br>
               3. People enjoy getting lost… or at least figuring their way out! <br>  Most people enjoy a challenge and the feeling that comes with figuring out a puzzle. <br> You can find your way through the challenging maze of curtains, <br> or hall of mirrors, but be careful… you might end up in a dead end! <br>
